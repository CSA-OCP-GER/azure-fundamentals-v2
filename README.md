# Azure Fundamentals bootcamp: start your journey on our Azure platform

The intend of this bootcamp is to begin the journey with Azure. The first step will be to build a common sense around basic terms of cloud concepts. With some hands-on in the Azure Portal we will leverage the first services out of azure and bring the attendees to the point, that they can prepare themselves for the first Azure certifications (e.g. AZ-100, AZ-101 or AZ-900).

The bootcamp is divided into four modules:

1. [Cloud concepts](\1_cloudconcepts\readme.md)
2. [Basic Azure services](\2_basic-azure-services\readme.md)
3. Security, Compliance and Trust
4. Azure pricing and support 

All modules will have a small quiz at the end to check your earned knowledge.

To start into the hands-on parts it will be helpful to have a Azure Subscription. If you don't have one - please use our Azure Free Trail account opportunity - https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/free/.
